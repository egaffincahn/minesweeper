# minesweeper
Back when I was learning Psychtoolbox and trying to become more proficient in MATLAB, I built a program that plays the classic Microsoft minesweeper game and shows the progress on the screen. The bot has a few shortcomings as far as the algorithm to play the game is concerned, but it still works pretty well. You can watch a video of it playing <a href="http://egc.nyc/files/minesweeper.gif">here</a>.
